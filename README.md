# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository will contain my work from the Master Algorithmic Programming Techniques Specialization that was created by UC San Diego and delivered through Coursera. I will be implementing solutions in Java. Fill free to fork in other languages ( the question pdfs is attached and the file extentions of different file format is also attached ).

## About This Course

The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).
